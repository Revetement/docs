## Unpacking .pack files

[twa_unpack](https://github.com/TotalWar-Modding/twa_unpack) and [rpfm](https://github.com/Frodo45127/rpfm) can unpack almost every .pack file. If you encounter a .pack file that cannot be opened, please open an issue!

## Decompiling .luac files

[unluac](https://sourceforge.net/projects/unluac/) should be able to decompile every .luac file of any total war game.
